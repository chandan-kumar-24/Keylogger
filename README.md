# Keylogger

-So you might be thinking that what is this keylogger, sounds so techie ! Well, let me tell you. 
### A keylogger or keystroke logger/keyboard capturing is a form of malware or hardware that keeps track of and records your keystrokes as you type. It takes the information and sends it to a hacker using a command-and-control (C&C) server.
This is really basic, but a powerful keylogger that must be handled with  care and respect for privacy rights of the user. Here i have used a vulnerable machine (Metasploitable 2) as C2C (Command and Control) server to capture the keystrokes in file and send it to FTP(File Trnasfer Protocol) server.
